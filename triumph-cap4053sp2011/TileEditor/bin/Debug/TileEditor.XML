        <member name="T:TileEditor.GraphicsDeviceService">
            <summary>
            Helper class responsible for creating and managing the GraphicsDevice.
            All GraphicsDeviceControl instances share the same GraphicsDeviceService,
            so even though there can be many controls, there will only ever be a single
            underlying GraphicsDevice. This implements the standard IGraphicsDeviceService
            interface, which provides notification events for when the device is reset
            or disposed.
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="M:TileEditor.GraphicsDeviceService.#ctor(System.IntPtr,System.Int32,System.Int32)">
            <summary>
            Constructor is private, because this is a singleton class:
            client controls should use the public AddRef method instead.
            </summary>

        <member name="M:TileEditor.GraphicsDeviceService.AddRef(System.IntPtr,System.Int32,System.Int32)">

        <member name="M:TileEditor.GraphicsDeviceService.Release(System.Boolean)">

        <member name="M:TileEditor.GraphicsDeviceService.ResetDevice(System.Int32,System.Int32)">
            <summary>
            Resets the graphics device to whichever is bigger out of the specified
            resolution or its current size. This behavior means the device will
            demand-grow to the largest of all its GraphicsDeviceControl clients.

        <member name="P:TileEditor.GraphicsDeviceService.GraphicsDevice">

        <member name="T:TileEditor.ServiceContainer">
            <summary>
            Container class implements the IServiceProvider interface. This is used
            to pass shared services between different components, for instance the
            ContentManager uses it to locate the IGraphicsDeviceService implementation.

        <member name="M:TileEditor.ServiceContainer.AddService``1(``0)">
            <summary>
            Adds a new service to the collection.

        </member>
        <member name="M:TileEditor.ServiceContainer.GetService(System.Type)">

        </member>
        <member name="T:TileEditor.GraphicsDeviceControl">
            <summary>
            Custom control uses the XNA Framework GraphicsDevice to render onto
            a Windows Form. Derived classes can override the Initialize and Draw
            methods to add their own drawing code.
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="M:TileEditor.GraphicsDeviceControl.OnCreateControl">
            <summary>
            Initializes the control.
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="M:TileEditor.GraphicsDeviceControl.Dispose(System.Boolean)">
            <summary>
            Disposes the control.
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="M:TileEditor.GraphicsDeviceControl.OnPaint(System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs)">
            <summary>
            Redraws the control in response to a WinForms paint message.
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="M:TileEditor.GraphicsDeviceControl.BeginDraw">
            <summary>
            Attempts to begin drawing the control. Returns an error message string
            if this was not possible, which can happen if the graphics device is
            lost, or if we are running inside the Form designer.
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="M:TileEditor.GraphicsDeviceControl.EndDraw">
            <summary>
            Ends drawing the control. This is called after derived classes
            have finished their Draw method, and is responsible for presenting
            the finished image onto the screen, using the appropriate WinForms
            control handle to make sure it shows up in the right place.
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="M:TileEditor.GraphicsDeviceControl.HandleDeviceReset">
            <summary>
            Helper used by BeginDraw. This checks the graphics device status,
            making sure it is big enough for drawing the current control, and
            that the device is not lost. Returns an error string if the device
            could not be reset.
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="M:TileEditor.GraphicsDeviceControl.PaintUsingSystemDrawing(System.Drawing.Graphics,System.String)">
            <summary>
            If we do not have a valid graphics device (for instance if the device
            is lost, or if we are running inside the Form designer), we must use
            regular System.Drawing method to display a status message.
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="M:TileEditor.GraphicsDeviceControl.OnPaintBackground(System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs)">
            <summary>
            Ignores WinForms paint-background messages. The default implementation
            would clear the control to the current background color, causing
            flickering when our OnPaint implementation then immediately draws some
            other color over the top using the XNA Framework GraphicsDevice.
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="M:TileEditor.GraphicsDeviceControl.Initialize">
            <summary>

        </member>
        <member name="M:TileEditor.GraphicsDeviceControl.Draw">
            <summary>
            Derived classes override this to draw themselves using the GraphicsDevice.

        </member>
        <member name="P:TileEditor.GraphicsDeviceControl.GraphicsDevice">
            <summary>
            Gets a GraphicsDevice that can be used to draw onto this control.

        </member>
        <member name="P:TileEditor.GraphicsDeviceControl.Services">
            <summary>
            Gets an IServiceProvider containing our IGraphicsDeviceService.
            This can be used with components such as the ContentManager,
            which use this service to look up the GraphicsDevice.
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="T:TileEditor.Properties.Resources">
            <summary>
              A strongly-typed resource class, for looking up localized strings, etc.

        </member>
        <member name="P:TileEditor.Properties.Resources.ResourceManager">
            <summary>
              Returns the cached ResourceManager instance used by this class.

        <member name="P:TileEditor.Properties.Resources.Culture">
            <summary>
              Overrides the current thread's CurrentUICulture property for all
              resource lookups using this strongly typed resource class.
